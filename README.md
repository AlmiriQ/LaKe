# LaKe
LaKe build system (make for lain => lain + make = lake)

# Usage
Create a "lakefile" in project directory
Fill it with python code
Run "lake" command in terminal

# Install (Linux)
Option 1: Run "make" and lake will be installed
Option 2: Manually compile lake.c, put it with lake.py into /sbin/ directory
Option 3: (if first did not work) try to use "sudo make"

Tested on KDE Neon (5.21 with Python 3.8) and Android 9 (Termux with Python 3.9)

Yeah, it's a bike, but I needed it. I wanted to have something more comfortable than make with lots of functional and without useless output like "moving to dir..."
This is not a big project, but it helps me.
